Welcome to Project Foundations
</h1>

### What is this?
Foundations is my collection of theory that I think would also be usable to others (mostly 42 students) or me in the future.

Currently it only hosts my [Hitchhiker's Guide to Undefined Behavior](https://github.com/leske42/Foundations/tree/main/UB) (this is an excerpt of a workshop I did with some additions), but I plan to make it grow.

Please read my nice guide in the meantime, it is super useful.
